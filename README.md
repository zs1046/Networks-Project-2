# Networks-Project-2

1. Overview

In this project, we are going to build a component of a Command and Control (C2C)
server that is used to allow agents in a multi-agent system to become aware of each
other. In particular, the C2C server should be able to maintain a list of active agents and
respond to various actions as issued by the agents. For example, the agents could be a
group of UAVs and the C2C server could be a satellite. The agents would need to
communicate through the satellite if they are out-of-range of each other. The C2C
server will run on a particular port (supplied by a command line argument) and should
be able to respond to TCP connections from agents. Agents send various actions to the
server to update the information maintained. The agent code is supplied in this
assignment and is written in C. An agent can issue one of those actions:

1- #JOIN

When the C2C server receives a join request, it will add this agent to its current
list of active agents and responds with “$OK”. An agent can only join once before
it leaves. If an agent tries to join while it is already an active agent, the C2C
server should respond with an error message “$ALREADY MEMBER”

2- #LEAVE

When the C2C server receives a leave request, it deletes the corresponding
agent from its list of active agents and responds with “$OK”. An agent cannot
leave if it has not already joined and the server responds with an error message
“$NOT MEMEBER”

3- #LIST

When the C2C server receives a list request, it responds with the list of all active
agents (agents that have joined, but not already left). The C2C server can only
respond to list actions from active agents (otherwise ignored and no response is
given). The list contains the IP address and duration in seconds (how many
seconds since an agent joined) for each agent. Each entry should be in the form 
of <agent_IP, seconds_online>. You may assume that each agent has a unique
IP. Requests generated from the same IP address are treated as a single agent.

4- #LOG

When the C2C server receives a log request, it responds with the log file (log.txt)
to the agent. Similar to list, only active agents can issue log requests. You can
assume that the log requests itself should be logged into the log file before its
gets sent to the agent. Note that the log file could be quite large, so make sure
not to try to load it into a buffer all at once.

The agent takes three arguments in its command line: the C2C server IP, server port
and the action string. It sends the action string and writes the response, if any, to the
screen. The agent code is listed under resources on TRACS.

The agent would connect to the server on its listening port and waits for a response to
its actions before it exits. All actions start with a ‘#’ and all responses start with ‘$’
followed by the data/message.

The C2C server should be able to listen for actions on the port it is running on and once
a request is received, the server responds with the information/confirmation based on its
current state (e.g., active list of agents, when they joined and the agent requesting the
information) and records its interactions in the log file. Notice that the C2C server will
never exit; it continues listening and servicing requests.

2. Log File

The C2C needs to maintain a log file the records any information about any given
connection along with a time stamp (up to millisecond granularity) and the response
sent (if any). You can assume the file is called log.txt. For example:
“TIME”: Received a “#JOIN” action from agent “147.26.143.22”
“TIME”: Responded to agent “147.26.143.22” with “$OK”
“TIME”: Received a “#LIST” action from agent “147.26.12.11”
“TIME”: No response is supplied to agent “147.26.12.11” (agent not active)
