Design Document

First step for the server was to create a socket.
Then binded that socket to the specified port.
Set the program to listen for a client.
Once it accepts a client it reads their message
and goes through if statements until the corresponding action
is found and carried out. The #LIST action lists all IP addresses conneted to server.
The #LOG function prints out all the action done on server with a timestamp.
The server should continue to listen for agents up to 6. Since the linux servers only have eros and zeus up, I only have access to 2 different terminals so I couldn't attempt from a third terminal but it should work.
